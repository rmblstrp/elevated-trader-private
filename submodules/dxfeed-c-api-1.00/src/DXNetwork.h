 *  Binds the connection to the specified address with the given context.

    Input:
        connection - the connection object to bind.
        address - a string containing the host address; should conform to the
               following pattern: <host>[:<port>], where <host> may either
               be a computer name or a domain name or an IP address string,
               and <port> is a text representation of a port number.
        ccd - a pointer to the connection context data structure, which must have
              a 'receiver' field assigned a non-NULL value.
             
    Return value:
        true - the connection has been successfully bound to the host.
